# Catalog Reports

Catalog Reports is a free, open source project from [Enterprise Data & Analytics](https://entdna.com/). There are two versions available:

[Catalog Reports](https://github.com/aleonard763/CatalogReports) – for native SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) deployment.

[Catalog Reports SP](https://github.com/aleonard763/CatalogReportsSP) – for SharePoint deployment.

Catalog Reports is designed to support Enterprise Data Integration Lifecycle Management (DILM) by decoupling SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) Catalog reporting from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

<p>Catalog Reports is a SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) solution built in SQL Server Data Tools – Business Intelligence 2013 (Visual Studio 2013) for the SSIS Catalog in SQL Server 2014.</p>

Included in the solution are four reports:
<li>Executions</li>
<li>Messages</li>
<li>Overview</li>
<li>Performance</li>

Catalog Reports will serve the enterprise data integration needs of many enterprises. For information regarding the enterprise DILM reporting solution included in SSIS Framework Commercial and Enterprise Editions, please contact [Enterprise Data & Analytics](http://entdna.com/contact).
